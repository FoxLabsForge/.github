## 🚀 About Us

"Where Curiosity Meets the Cosmos and Innovation Soars."

At FoxLabs, we are charting new frontiers in citizen-led STEM, boldly venturing into the realms of cybersecurity, space exploration, pushing automata, neural networks and quantum computing. Our mission is to explore, innovate, and secure the digital future for the betterment of humanity.

#### 🌌 Exploring the Unknown

With a passion for cyber security, space sciences and orbital technologies, we embark on exciting OSS (*Open Source Software*) projects. Our projects range from space weather monitoring to satellite communication simulations!

#### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Guardians

In the digital age, security is paramount. We're on a mission to safeguard the digital landscape, creating tools and solutions for both offence and defence in this regard projects can shift from encryption suites to automata programs for seamless maintenance and CI (*Continuous Integration*) of security updates which blends well with ventures made into OSS AI linguistic models for both chat-bots, confidence analysis and, well, a wide array of situations.
